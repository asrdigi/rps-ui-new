        <div style="background-color:powderblue;">
            Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a combination of web application <br>
            development technologies that make web applications more responsive to user interaction. <br>
            Whenever your users interact with a web application, such as when they click buttons or checkmark <br>
            boxes, the browser exchanges data with the remote server. Data exchange can cause pages to <br>
            reload and interrupt the user experience. With AJAX, web applications can send and receive data<br>
            in the background so that only small portions of the page refresh as required.

        </div>

        <div  style="background-color:rgb(175, 174, 120);" id="divId">This portion will be changed</div>
        <div class="append-to-me"></div>
        <div style="background-color:rgb(218, 233, 245);">
            You can use AJAX to create various features in web applications.
                Autocomplete

                Search engines provide autocomplete options in real time when users search for a <br>
                specific keyword in the search bar. AJAX allows the webpage to relay each character <br>
                input to the web server and return a list of relevant recommendations on the existing page.
                <br>Form verification

                <br>AJAX allows web applications to validate specific information in forms before users 
                <br>submit them. For example, when a new user creates an account, the webpage can 
                <br>automatically verify if a username is available before the user moves to the next section.
